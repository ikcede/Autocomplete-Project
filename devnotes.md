Dev Notes
---------

Planned changes at some (probably far) point in the future:

* JS Structures documentation
* Eventually switch the trie into a ternary search tree
* Settings for which documents and algorithms to use 
* UI (keybindings, etc)
* File saving
* Prediction of future text
* Online algorithm

Even further off:

* Inverse document frequency
* NLP support
* Theme recognition (or as a feature vector)
* Implement using conditional random fields to guess words
